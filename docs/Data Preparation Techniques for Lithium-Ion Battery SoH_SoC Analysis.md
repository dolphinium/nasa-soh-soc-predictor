# Data Preparation Techniques for Lithium-Ion Battery SoH/SoC Analysis

## NASA Battery Dataset Structure

The NASA lithium-ion battery dataset is a comprehensive collection of battery cycling data that includes:

- Multiple battery cells (B0005, B0006, B0007, B0018) tested under different conditions
- Data collected under constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol
- Discharge tests conducted at various cutoff voltages (2.0V, 2.2V, 2.5V, 2.7V)
- Measurements including voltage, current, temperature, and capacity
- Impedance measurements conducted through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
- Data organized in cycles, with each cycle containing a complete charge-discharge sequence
- Raw data provided in .mat files with experiment details in README.txt files

The batteries were charged at a constant current of 1.5A until reaching 4.2V, then switched to constant voltage mode until the current dropped to 20mA. Discharge was conducted at a constant current of 2A-4A until reaching the cutoff voltage.

## Common Preprocessing Techniques

Based on the literature review, the following preprocessing techniques are commonly used for battery datasets:

### 1. Time-Domain to SOC-Domain Transformation

As described in the paper "Battery State-of-Health Estimation Using Machine Learning and Preprocessing with Relative State-of-Charge," transforming time-domain data into SOC-domain data significantly improves model performance. This transformation:

- Makes data more correlated with usable capacity
- Reduces the impact of varying discharge rates
- Normalizes data across different cycles
- Improves model generalization capabilities

### 2. Data Cleaning and Filtering

- Removal of outliers and anomalous measurements
- Filtering of noise using moving average or low-pass filters
- Handling of missing values through interpolation
- Removal of incomplete cycles
- Identification and handling of sensor errors

### 3. Feature Extraction

As demonstrated in "Health State Estimation Method of Lithium Ion Battery Based on NASA Experimental Data Set," key features that can be extracted include:

- Time required for charging voltage to reach 4.2V
- Time required for charging temperature to reach maximum value
- Time required for discharging voltage to reach cutoff voltage
- Time required for discharging temperature to reach maximum value

Additional features commonly extracted:

- Voltage curves during constant current and constant voltage phases
- Capacity fade rate between cycles
- Internal resistance calculated from voltage drop
- Coulombic efficiency (ratio of discharge capacity to charge capacity)
- Voltage recovery after rest periods

### 4. Data Minimization

The paper "Research on Minimization of Data Set for State of Charge Prediction" demonstrates that:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce dimensionality
- Periodic analysis of battery data can identify patterns
- Data fusion techniques can combine different data sources
- Single-parameter (voltage only) SoC prediction is possible with proper preprocessing
- Input data can be reduced by over 90% while maintaining prediction accuracy

### 5. Normalization and Standardization

- Min-max normalization to scale features to [0,1] range
- Z-score standardization to normalize features to zero mean and unit variance
- Capacity normalization relative to rated capacity
- Cycle normalization to account for different cycle lengths
- Temperature compensation to normalize measurements across different ambient temperatures

### 6. Handling Aging Effects

- Adjustment of rated capacity based on estimated SoH
- Segmentation of data into different aging stages
- Incorporation of cycle number as a feature
- Differential analysis to identify capacity fade patterns
- Reference performance tests at regular intervals

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Start with thorough data exploration** to understand the specific characteristics of the battery dataset

2. **Apply appropriate filtering techniques** to remove noise while preserving important signal features

3. **Extract domain-specific features** that capture the physical degradation mechanisms of batteries

4. **Transform time-domain data to SOC-domain** when building models for SoH/SoC estimation

5. **Use dimensionality reduction** to focus on the most informative aspects of the data

6. **Normalize features appropriately** to ensure fair comparison across different operating conditions

7. **Segment data by operating conditions** (temperature, discharge rate) for more accurate modeling

8. **Consider both time-series and statistical features** for comprehensive battery state estimation

9. **Validate preprocessing steps** by checking correlation with capacity degradation

10. **Document all preprocessing steps** to ensure reproducibility and interpretability of results

## Conclusion

Effective data preparation is crucial for accurate SoH and SoC estimation in lithium-ion batteries. The techniques identified in this literature review provide a solid foundation for preprocessing the NASA battery dataset. By applying these methods, we can enhance the performance of machine learning models for battery state estimation while reducing computational requirements through data minimization strategies.
