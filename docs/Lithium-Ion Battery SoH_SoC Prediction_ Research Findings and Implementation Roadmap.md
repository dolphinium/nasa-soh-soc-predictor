Each dataset represents a different battery with varying operating conditions and degradation patterns.

### Preprocessing Techniques

Based on the literature review, the following preprocessing techniques are recommended for battery datasets:

   - Preserves the relationship between values
   - Suitable for neural network inputs

2. **Z-Score Normalization**: For unbounded variables
   - Standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance
   - Improves convergence in many ML algorithms

3. **Robust Scaling**: For data with outliers

### Time Series Analysis Techniques

#### 1. Cycle-by-Cycle Analysis

Analyzing battery data on a cycle-by-cycle basis reveals degradation patterns:
- Tracks capacity fade and resistance increase across cycles
- Identifies breakpoints or regime changes in degradation rate
- Compares degradation rates under different operational conditions
- Visualizes trajectory of key health indicators over battery lifetime

#### 2. Differential Voltage Analysis (DVA)

DVA is particularly effective for identifying specific aging mechanisms:
